  
Homemade Shepherd’s Pie
Ingredients
1 tablespoon oil
1 pound ground beef
1 clove garlic chopped
2 onions finely chopped
2 medium carrots finely diced
2 sticks celery finely diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons white flour
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/3 cup red wine OR more broth if avoiding alcohol
1 cup beef broth
1 cup frozen peas
1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped thyme
1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary
4 cups mashed potatoes 
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
Instructions
Brown meat and vegetables:
Heat the oil over medium high heat in a large, deep skillet. Brown the ground meat, then add the chopped vegetables and sauté until softened.
Season and deglaze the pan:
Sprinkle salt, paprika, pepper and flour over the pan. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring often. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring all the time, until it smells roasted (about 1 minute). Pour in the red wine (OR beef broth if you prefer!), scratching any browned bits off the bottom.
Finish filling and cool:
Then stir in broth, herbs and peas, simmer 4-5 minutes and then let cool in a 7×11 inch baking dish.
Prep mash:
In the meantime, make your favorite mashed potatoes. You need about 4 cups of mash to top off the casserole. About 1.5 pounds of peeled potatoes should yield enough.
Bake pie:
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Spread the mashed potatoes over the cold filling. (Be careful not to mix up the two.) Criss-cross with a fork for a great look and crispy edges! Sprinkle with the cheese. Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes or until golden (I recommend baking on a lined baking sheet to catch any spills)
