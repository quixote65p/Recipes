Beef and broccoli
2 lbs.  top sirloin steak sliced into very thin 2” strips
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 cups (12 oz.) broccoli florets chopped into bite size pieces
Sauce
1 cup low sodium beef broth
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup oyster sauce
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons Japanese rice wine or dry sherry see notes in post
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1-3 teaspoons Asian chili sauce I use sambal oelek
4-6 cloves garlic, minced (may sub 1 - 1 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder)
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger (may sub 1 teaspoon ground ginger)
1/2 tsp EACH pepper, onion powder
Crockpot Beef and Broccoli
INSTRUCTIONS
While the beef slices are still on the cutting board, pat dry and toss with ½ teaspoon salt; set aside.
Add all of the sauce ingredients to the slow cooker and whisk until the cornstarch dissolves. Add the beef and stir to combine. Cover and cook on LOW for 3-4 hours, until the meat is very tender.

Once the beef is tender, you can thicken the sauce more on the stove (recommended), or leave it alone. Using an oven mitt, tilt the slow cooker to the side and ladle out as much sauce as possible into a saucepan; set aside. Add broccoli to the top of the beef in the slow cooker and cover (don’t stir in, we want the broccoli to steam). Cook for 20-30 additional minutes or until the broccoli reaches desired crisp-tenderness.

Towards the end of the 20 minutes, simmer the sauce on the stove until quite thick. You want it thicker than the final desired consistency because it will thin when combined with the broccoli in the slow cooker. Transfer thickened sauce to the slow cooker and stir to combine. Serve with rice and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions if desired.
