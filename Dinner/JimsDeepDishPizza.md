Jim's Chicago Style Deep Dish üçï pizza
The Dough
Work in light flour
There are many variations on pizza dough and you can surf the Internet to find what you like best, however when it came to the dough I wanted it to be as authentic as possible. Problem is, these Chicago pizzerias don‚Äôt exactly give out their recipes. Here I did a LOT of research and found what I believe to be the closest to the original as I could find, it is fantastic and is supposed to be similar dough from Pizzeria Uno. So, this is the recipe I use, it is simple, but really good. I did make some minor changes to his recipe. This dough is great for deep dish as well as thin crust.
* 2 1\2 packages instant rise dry yeast 
* 2 cups warm spring water 
* 1/2 cup olive oil (My preference)
* 1/2 cup cornmeal, ground fine (My preference)
* 5 1/2 cups bread flour Note- Chicago Dep Dish uses AP, my prefferance is Bread Flour, both   work. AP will be a bit more flaky
* two tbls of salt (add salt last after kneading)
*2 tbls corn oil (My Preference)
Dough NOTE 1:  WHOLE WHEAT -Since this article was published, I have sinced changed the flour recipe by adding whole wheat flour. This makes a light multi grain crust that taste better and is better on the diet. It really is a better crust. Try this:
3 cups bread flour, 2  1\2 cups of whole wheat, and 1\2 cup finley ground cornmeal. GREAT dough!
Dough Note 2: Some restaurants in Chicago do use lard \ Crisco instead of or with corn or olive oil. While this will make for a rich great crust, us health conscience folks prefer good old olive oil. If you don't have a weight problem and the doc says you are healthy as a horse, try the lard. Both are actually fantastic. If you are going to be using this dough for a high temp pie on a grill like 600+ degrees, stick with the olive oil and skip the lard, and do NOT use butter in your dough. It will burn.
Dough Note 3: My recipe calls for the dough to raise three+ hours. Some Chicago restaurants will let their dough raise all day, and also put in the fridge overnight. This does work fine however a four hour raise to me works well. Try both and see which you like best.
Dough Note 4: SOURDOUGH STARTER! A great tip for making some excellent pie crust. Make your own wild starter or purchase on line. I use two, one wild and one that is the KAF 250 yr old starter. If you use a starter, use less yeast and do a cold overnight rise for sure. Much more about starters on our Neo-Ny Pizza recipe and Baugh's Baguette recipe. Check them out here on the Galley Blog.
Kneading and preping the dough:
Dissolve the yeast in the water until it foams (proof). Or you can just put the yeast straight into the mix. Add the vegetable oil, olive oil, cornmeal, and half of the flour. Beat for 3 minutes. The dough will be very wet like a pancake batter. Then let sit covered for 20 minutes.Then mix in the remaining flour. Knead for about 10 minutes in mixer on low then increase after 7 minutes. Then place dough on granite countertop mixing in flour lightly. Kneading by hand only a few minutes. The dough should not really be sticky at all.
Remove dough and place on a clean countertop or bowl. Cover and allow to rise in warm place until double in bulk. Bout three \ four hours. Be sure to coat the dough with olive oil prior to raise. OR, at this time you can put it in the fridge overnight and take out the next morning. Some people like to let the dough stand in the fridge from 2 to even 5 or six days. Overnight should provide you will a dough that will be wonderfull. I have let dough stand for two days in the fridge. Results were good. There is also nothing wrong with just a four hour raise.
If you have left over dough, vacuum seal it and freeze for later use.
NOTE: This dough recipe is enough to make two 9 inch square pan pizzas, and have enough left over for a 10 inch snack pizza.
Filling
Cheese goes first, not the sauce
When we go to the trouble to make home made deep-dish pizza, a simple cheese pie is not going to cut it. Ours is this combination: Italian sausage, hamburger, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, hickory smoked bacon, mushroom, onion, Spinach, sliced tomato and green pepper. 
Pre cook meats and veggies
Take your hamburger and sausage and cook them together in a cast iron skillet then drain off the fat. Next, lightly cook the Canadian bacon until it is golden brown then set aside. Next cook your bacon, drain the fat, and set the bacon aside. Wipe the skillet and lightly saut√© the veggies until they are tender, then set aside.
Layer veggies on top of meats
This is probably the biggest difference between Jims Deep Dish, and authentic Chicago deep dish Pizza. Some of the Chicago pizzerias use raw sausage right in the pie and all the grease stays in the pie. I find it a much better pie to precook the meats and drain the fat. It is healthier, and the pie is saucy enough as it is, it does not need the extra grease.
Sauce
Sauce goes last
Sauce is a matter of preference. There are some restaurants that actually just pour the tomatoes right from the can with little seasoning and away you go.  Here is what you will need for a cooked sauce.
Cooked Sauce
One large can tomato sauce
Olive oil
Fresh chopped Garlic
One Caned tomatoes cut (San Marzanos)
Crushed red peppers
Sugar- teaspoon
Some onion salt
Dash Oregano
Dash Parsley
Chopped Basil
Dash of thyme
salt 1\2 teaspoon
Parm Cheese 1\4 cup
* Use fresh ingredients if possible.
First heat olive oil is saucepan then saut√© the garlic. Next, just add everything and simmer with a closed lid for at least 35 minutes. Let cool to room temperature with the lid on. Lastly, store in a GLASS jar and keep in the fridge 24 hours before serving. NOTE: The red wine vinegar helps give the sauce a bit of zing or tang which works very well, but optional.
UNCOOKED SAUCE, 
best with fresh herbs, mix all together, let sit overnight.
28 oz. can San Marzano tomatoes
2 oz.  tomato paste
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese
3 Tbls. minced garlic
1 Tbls. black pepper
1 Tbls. granulated sugar
3 tsp. fresh basil
1 tsp. fresh oregano
crushed red pepper to taste
Teaspoon Sea Salt
Assembling the Pie
Ready for oven at 455, lower rack
Grease your stoneware dish with olive oil up to and around the sides. Place your dough in the center of the dish and push \ work outwards towards the side of the pan. Pull the dough up the sides of the dish. The crust on the bottom should be fairly thin. The crust on the sides should be also. Make sure that the inside bottom corners of the pan do not stack up with dough. Keep pushing the excess dough out of the corners and up and over the sides of the pan. Deep Dish should NOT be an extremely thick crust, actually quite thin everywhere. You don‚Äôt want to end up with a loaf of bread with sauce on it!
Next, place your cheese on top of the dough, and then add all of your pre-cooked meats on top of the cheese. Next up, add your veggies.
Finally, pour your sauce on top and garnish with Parnassian Cheese. I like to also put some fresh basil on top of the sauce just because I love basil! Never get enough. You should see the size of my basil bush, huge!
Cooking
Preheat to 455 and cook for 40-50 minutes. Place pie on the bottom of the rack. If the crust is getting to brown on top just use some aluminum foil at the end to cover. (Usually not necessary) When done, let stand for five minutes or longer then serve.
This recipe is based on the authentic Chicago style Deep Dish Pizza, with some variation. Basically, we just drain the fat off the precooked meats and also like to use a lot of basil, oregano, and parsley. As far as the sauce, we like it either pre cooked, or not. Our preference is to precook and let the sauce sit over night in a glass jar in the fridge. 
Making a deep dish pizza is a little bit like making a Lasagna, you can pretty much make it anyway you want, and as many layers as you want. Stuffed pizzas are popular however a deep-dish pizza has enough dough already. To protect my six-pac abs, one layer of dough is enough for me!!!
